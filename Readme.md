I am Colombian, electronic engineer and in the last 14 years I have worked with oil service companies in Colombia, Angola and Bolivia.

I’m a persevering man, focused on my goals and willing to make them come true.

I’m passionate about electronics and the development of solutions in home automation and the internet of things.

I have achieved this objective by working with different kind of small low-cost and highly reliable electronic modules, which have the capacity to process digital and analog inputs and outputs with different wired and wireless communication protocols.

Thus achieving the development of software optimized for each specific need.

But when it comes to more complex systems that contain a large number of devices of different technologies and brands, it becomes complex to bring everything together in a single user interface. Since many manufacturers handle their own applications and many are not compatible with each other and are even mutually exclusive.

For this reason, one of my goals is to become a web developer, focusing on the integration of different communication technologies to create a simple, intuitive user interface capable of controlling, monitoring, and keeping operating. I am interested in becoming a full stack developer, since that way I will be able to receive, store, process, share all the data captured and sent by the different types of sensors and actuators. A very important factor is security in communication with the outside world, since this can be filtered with sensitive user information. For this reason, a robust, redundant and reliable storage platform must be created, as well as encrypted and secure communication protocols.
